                        <p>In one and only one class, the servlet alone has to do various tasks such
                            as,
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Hence there are some problems that are associated with the servlets- </p>
                        
                        <p>For developing a servlet based application, knowledge of Java as well as
                            HTML
                            code is necessary. </p>
                        
                        <p>While developing any web based application, if a look and feel of the web
                            based application needs to be
                            changed then the entire source code to be changed and recompiled. </p>
                        
                        <p>There are some <strong>web page development tools </strong><br> available
                            using which the developer can
                            develop the web based applications. But the servlets do not support such
                            tools. Even if such tools are
                            used for a servlet, we need to change the embedded HTML code manually,
                            which
                            is a time consuming, error
                            prone and complicated process. </p>
                        
                        <p>What is Java Server Pages? </p>
                        
                        <p>The problems that are associated with servlets are due to one and only
                            one
                            reason and that is servlet has
                            to handle all the tasks of request processing. Java Server Pages (JSP)
                            is
                            one technology that came up to
                            overcome these problems. JSP is a technology in which request
                            processing,
                            business logic and
                            presentations are separated out. JSP is a technology for developing web
                            pages that support dynamic
                            content which helps developers insert java code in HTML pages by making
                            use
                            of special JSP tags, most of
                            which start with &lt;% and end with %&gt;. A Java Server </p>
                        
                        <p>Pages component is a type of Java servlet that is designed to fulfill the
                            role of a user interface for a
                            Java web application. Web developers write JSPs as text files that
                            combine
                            HTML or XHTML code, XML
                            elements, and embedded JSP actions and commands. Using JSP, you can
                            collect
                            input from users through web
                            page forms, present records from a database or another source, and
                            create
                            web pages dynamically. JSP
                            tags can be used for a variety of purposes, such as retrieving
                            information
                            from a database or
                            registering user preferences, accessing JavaBeans components, passing
                            control between pages and sharing
                            information between requests, pages etc. </p>
                        
                        <p>Advantages of JSP: </p>
                        
                        <p>Following is the list of other advantages of using JSP over other
                            technologies: </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Active Server Pages (ASP): </strong><br>The advantages of JSP are
                            twofold. First, the dynamic part is
                            written in Java, not Visual Basic or other MS specific language, so it
                            is
                            more powerful and easier to
                            use. Second, it is portable to other operating systems and non-Microsoft
                            Web
                            servers. </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Pure Servlets: </strong><br>It is more convenient to write (and
                            to
                            modify!) regular HTML than to have
                            plenty of println statements that generate the HTML. </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Server-Side Includes (SSI): </strong><br>SSI is really only
                            intended
                            for simple inclusions, not for
                            "real" programs that use form data, make database connections, and the
                            like.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>JavaScript: </strong><br>JavaScript can generate HTML dynamically
                            on
                            the client but can hardly
                            interact with the web server to perform complex tasks like database
                            access
                            and image processing etc.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Static HTML: </strong><br>Regular HTML, of course, cannot contain
                            dynamic information. </p>
                        
                        <p>JSP Architecture: </p>
                        
                        <p>The web server needs a JSP engine i.e., container to process JSP pages.
                            The
                            JSP container is responsible
                            for intercepting requests for JSP pages. A JSP container works with the
                            Web
                            server to provide the
                            runtime environment and other services a JSP needs. It knows how to
                            understand the special elements that
                            are part of JSPs. Following diagram shows the position of JSP container
                            and
                            JSP files in a Web
                            Application. </p>
                        
                        <p> </p>
                        
                        <div><img src="#"></div>
                        
                        <p>The Anatomy of a JSP Page: </p>
                        
                        <p>The JSP page is a simple web page which contains the <strong>JSP elements
                            </strong><br> and <strong>template
                                text </strong><br>. </p>
                        
                        <p>The template text can be any scripting code such as HTML, WML, XML, or a
                            simple plain text. Various JSP
                            elements can be action tags, custom tags, JSTL, and library elements.
                            These
                            JSP elements are responsible
                            for generating dynamic contents. </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>JSP Code: </strong><br></p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;% @page language = "java" contentType= "text/html"%&gt; <strong>JSP

                        <p>JSP Processing: </p>
                        
                        <p>The following steps explain how the web server creates the web page using
                            JSP: </p>
                        
                        <p>As with a normal page, your browser sends an HTTP request to the web
                            server.
                            The web server recognizes
                            that the HTTP request is for a JSP page and forwards it to a JSP engine.
                            This is done by using the URL
                            or JSP page which ends with <strong>. </strong><br><strong>jsp
                            </strong><br><strong> </strong><br>instead of .html.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The JSP engine loads the JSP page from disk and converts it into servlet
                            content. This conversion is very
                            simple in which all template text is converted to println( ) statements
                            and
                            all JSP elements are
                            converted to Java code that implements the corresponding dynamic
                            behavior of
                            the page. </p>
                        
                        <p>The JSP engine compiles the servlet into an executable class and forwards
                            the
                            original request to a
                            servlet engine. </p>
                        
                        <p>A part of the web server called the servlet engine loads the Servlet
                            class
                            and executes it. During
                            execution, the servlet produces an output in HTML format, which the
                            servlet
                            engine passes to the web
                            server inside an HTTP response. </p>
                        
                        <p>The web server forwards the HTTP response to your browser in terms of
                            static
                            HTML content. </p>
                        
                        <p>Finally web browser handles the dynamically generated HTML page inside
                            the
                            HTTP response exactly as if it
                            were a static page. </p>
                        
                        <p>Typically, the JSP engine checks whether a servlet for a JSP file already
                            exists and whether the
                            modification date on the JSP is older than the servlet. If the JSP is
                            older
                            than its generated servlet,
                            the JSP container assumes that the JSP hasn't changed and that the
                            generated
                            servlet still matches the
                            JSP's contents. This makes the process more efficient than with other
                            scripting languages (such as PHP)
                            and therefore faster. So in a way, a JSP page is really just another way
                            to
                            write a servlet without
                            having to be a Java programming wiz. Except for the translation phase, a
                            JSP
                            page is handled exactly
                            like a regular servlet. All the above mentioned steps can be shown below
                            in
                            the following diagram: </p>
                        
                        <div><img src="#"></div>
                        
                        <p><strong>JSP Life Cycle: </strong><br> </p>
                        
                        <p>The key to understanding the low-level functionality of JSP is to
                            understand
                            the simple life cycle they
                            follow. A JSP life cycle can be defined as the entire process from its
                            creation till the destruction
                            which is similar to a servlet life cycle with an additional step which
                            is
                            required to compile a JSP into
                            servlet. </p>
                        
                        <p>The following are the paths followed by a JSP </p>
                        
                        <p>Compilation </p>
                        
                        <p>Initialization </p>
                        
                        <p>Execution </p>
                        
                        <p>Destroying </p>
                        
                        <p>The three major phases of JSP life cycle are very similar to Servlet Life
                            Cycle and they are as follows:
                        </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>JSP Compilation: </strong><br> </p>
                        
                        <p>When a browser asks for a JSP, the JSP engine first checks to see whether
                            it
                            needs to compile the page.
                            If the page has never been compiled, or if the JSP has been modified
                            since
                            it was last compiled, the JSP
                            engine compiles the page. The compilation process involves three steps:
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Parsing the JSP. </p>
                        
                        <p>Turning the JSP into a servlet. </p>
                        
                        <p>Compiling the servlet. </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>JSP Initialization: </strong><br> </p>
                        
                        <p>When a container loads a JSP it invokes the jspInit() method before
                            servicing
                            any requests. If you need
                            to perform JSP-specific initialization, override the jspInit() method:
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>public void jspInit() { // Initialization code... </p>
                        
                        <p>} </p>
                        
                        <p>Typically initialization is performed only once and as with the servlet
                            init
                            method, you generally
                            initialize database connections, open files, and create lookup tables in
                            the
                            jspInit method. </p>
                        
                        <div><img src="#"></div>
                        
                        <p><strong>JSP Execution: </strong><br> </p>
                        
                        <p>This phase of the JSP life cycle represents all interactions with
                            requests
                            until the JSP is destroyed.
                            Whenever a browser requests a JSP and the page has been loaded and
                            initialized, the JSP engine invokes
                            the <strong>_ </strong><br><strong>jspService </strong><br><strong>()
                            </strong><br>method in the JSP. The
                            _jspService() method takes an <strong>HttpServletRequest
                            </strong><br><strong> </strong><br>and an
                            <strong>HttpServletResponse </strong><br><strong> </strong><br>as its
                            parameters as follows:
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>void _jspService(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse
                            response) {
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>// Service handling code... </p>
                        
                        <p>} </p>
                        
                        <p>The _jspService() method of a JSP is invoked once per a request and is
                            responsible for generating the
                            response for that request and this method is also responsible for
                            generating
                            responses to all seven of
                            the HTTP methods ie. GET, POST, DELETE etc. </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>4. JSP Cleanup: </strong><br> </p>
                        
                        <p>The destruction phase of the JSP life cycle represents when a JSP is
                            being
                            removed from use by a
                            container. The <strong>jspDestroy </strong><br><strong>()
                            </strong><br>method is the JSP equivalent of the
                            destroy method for servlets. Override jspDestroy when you need to
                            perform
                            any cleanup, such as releasing
                            database connections or closing open files. The jspDestroy() method has
                            the
                            following form: </p>
                        
                        <p>public void jspDestroy() </p>
                        
                        <p>{ </p>
                        
                        <p>// Your cleanup code goes here. } </p>
                        
                        <p>JSP Application Design with MVC: </p>
                        
                        <p>The design model of JSP application is called MVC model. The <strong>MVC
                            </strong><br> stands for
                            <strong>M </strong><br>odel-<strong>V </strong><br>iew-<strong>C
                            </strong><br>ontroller. The basic idea in MVC design
                            model is to separate out design logic into three parts – modeling,
                            viewing,
                            and controlling. Any server
                            application is classified into three parts such as business logic,
                            presentation, and request processing.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The <strong>business logic </strong><br>means the coding logic applied
                            for
                            manipulation of application data.
                            The <strong>presentation </strong><br> refers to the code written for
                            look
                            and feel of the web page. For
                            example: background color, font style, font size, placing of controls
                            such
                            as text boxes, command
                            buttons and so on. The request processing is nothing but a combination
                            of
                            business logic and
                            presentation. The request processing is always done in order to generate
                            the
                            response. According to the
                            MVC design model, the Model corresponds to business logic, View
                            corresponds
                            to presentation and
                            Controller corresponds to request processing. </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Advantages of using MVC design Model: </strong><br></p>
                        
                        <p>The use of MVC architecture allows the developer to keep the separation
                            between business logic,
                            presentation and request processing. Due to this separation it becomes
                            easy
                            to make
                            <strong>changes </strong><br> in presentation without disturbing the
                            business logic. The changes in
                            presentation are often required for accommodating the new presentation
                            interfaces.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>JSP Elements: </p>
                        
                        <p>Java Server Page is facilitated with three types of elements. They are as
                            follows: i) JSP Directives ii)
                            JSP Actions iii) JSP Scripting Elements </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>1) JSP Directives: </strong><br></p>
                        
                        <p>JSP directives provide directions and instructions to the container,
                            telling
                            it how to handle certain
                            aspects of JSP processing. It usually has the following form: &lt;%@
                            directive attribute="value" %&gt;
                            There are three types of directive tag are available in JSP: </p>

                        <p><strong>The include Directive: </strong><br></p>
                        
                        <p>The <strong>include </strong><br>directive is used to includes a file
                            during
                            the translation phase. This
                            directive tells the container to merge the content of other external
                            files
                            with the current JSP during
                            the translation phase. You may code <em>include </em>directives anywhere
                            in
                            your JSP page. The general
                            usage form of this directive is as follows: </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;%@ include file="relative-url" &gt; </p>
                        
                        <p>The filename in the include directive is actually a relative URL. If you
                            just
                            specify a filename with no
                            associated path, the JSP compiler assumes that the file is in the same
                            directory as your JSP. You can
                            write XML equivalent of the above syntax as follows: </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;jsp:include file="relative-url" /&gt; </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>The </strong><br><strong>taglib </strong><br><strong> Directive:
                            </strong><br> </p>
                        
                        <p>The Java Server Pages API allows you to define custom JSP tags that look
                            like
                            HTML or XML tags and a tag
                            library is a set of user-defined tags that implement custom behavior.
                            The
                            <strong>taglib </strong><br><strong> </strong><br>directive declares
                            that
                            your JSP page uses a set of custom
                            tags, identifies the location of the library, and provides a means for
                            identifying the custom tags in
                            your JSP page. The taglib directive follows the following syntax:
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;%@taglib uri="uri" prefix="prefixOfTag"&gt; </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>2) JSP Actions: </strong><br> </p>
                        
                        <p>JSP actions use constructs in XML syntax to control the behavior of the
                            servlet engine. You can
                            dynamically insert a file, reuse JavaBeans components, forward the user
                            to
                            another page, or generate
                            HTML for the Java plugin. There is only one syntax for the Action
                            element,
                            as it conforms to the XML

                        <p>There are two attributes that are common to all Action elements: the
                            <strong>id </strong><br>attribute and
                            the <strong>scope </strong><br>attribute.<strong> </strong><br>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Id attribute: </strong><br>The id attribute uniquely identifies
                            the
                            Action element, and allows the
                            action to be referenced inside the JSP page. If the Action creates an
                            instance of an object the id value
                            can be used to reference it through the implicit object PageContext </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Scope attribute: </strong><br>This attribute identifies the
                            lifecycle
                            of the Action element. The id
                            attribute and the scope attribute are directly related, as the scope
                            attribute determines the lifespan
                            of the object associated with the id. The scope attribute has four
                            possible
                            values: a) page </p>

                        <p>The <strong>useBean </strong><br><strong> </strong><br>action is quite
                            versatile. It first searches for an
                            existing object utilizing the id and scope variables. If an object is
                            not
                            found, it then tries to create
                            the specified object. </p>
                        
                        <p>The simplest way to load a bean is as follows: </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;jsp:useBean /&gt; </p>
                        
                        <p>Once a bean class is loaded, you can use <strong>jsp:setProperty

                            <strong>jsp:getProperty </strong><br><strong> </strong><br>actions to
                            modify
                            and retrieve bean properties.

                        <p>The <strong>setProperty </strong><br><strong> </strong><br>action sets
                            the
                            properties of a Bean. The Bean must
                            have been previously defined before this action. There are two basic
                            ways to
                            use the setProperty action:
                            You can use jsp:setProperty after, but outside of, a jsp:useBean
                            element, as
                            below: &lt;jsp:useBean ...
                            /&gt; </p>
                        
                        <p>... </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;jsp:setProperty name="myName" property="someProperty" .../&gt; </p>
                        
                        <p>In this case, the jsp:setProperty is executed regardless of whether a new
                            bean was instantiated or an
                            existing bean was found. </p>
                        
                        <p>A second context in which jsp:setProperty can appear is inside the body
                            of a
                            jsp:useBean element, as
                            below: </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;jsp:useBean ... &gt; </p>
                        
                        <p>... </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;jsp:setProperty name="myName" property="someProperty" .../&gt; </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;/jsp:useBean&gt; </p>
                        
                        <p>Here, the jsp:setProperty is executed only if a new object was
                            instantiated,
                            not if an existing one was
                            found. Following is the list of attributes associated with setProperty

                            </strong><br><strong>&gt; Action: </strong><br></p>
                        
                        <p>The <strong>plugin </strong><br>action is used to insert Java components
                            into
                            a JSP page. It determines the
                            type of browser and inserts the &lt;object&gt; or &lt;embed&gt; tags as
                            needed. If the needed plugin is
                            not present, it downloads the plugin and then executes the Java
                            component.
                            The Java component can be
                            either an Applet or a JavaBean. The plugin action has several attributes
                            that correspond to common HTML
                            tags used to format Java components. The &lt;param&gt; element can also
                            be
                            used to send parameters to
                            the Applet or Bean. Following is the typical syntax of using plugin
                            action:
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;jsp:plugin type="applet" codebase="dirname" code="MyApplet.class"

                            element, can be used to specify an error string to be sent to the user
                            in
                            case the component fails. </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>3) JSP Scripting Elements: </strong><br></p>
                        
                        <p>JSP scripting elements can be used to embed the Java code into the JSP
                            file,
                            declare variables and also
                            attach the results to the HTML content. There are four types of
                            scripting
                            elements are available. They
                            are: </p>
                        
                        <p>i) Scriptlets ii) Declarations iii) Expressions iv) Comments </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>The </strong><br><strong>Scriptlet </strong><br><strong>:
                            </strong><br> </p>
                        
                        <p>scriptlet can contain any number of JAVA language statements, variable or
                            method declarations, or
                            expressions that are valid in the java server page scripting language.
                            Following is the syntax of
                            Scriptlet: </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;% code fragment %&gt; </p>
                        
                        <p>Any text, HTML tags, or JSP elements you write must be outside the
                            scriptlet.
                            Following is the simple
                            example for JSP: </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;html&gt; </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;body&gt; </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;% </p>
                        
                        <p>out.println("Your IP address is " + request.getRemoteAddr()); </p>
                        
                        <p>%&gt; </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Declarations: </strong><br> </p>
                        
                        <p>declaration declares one or more variables or methods that you can use in
                            Java code later in the JSP
                            file. You must declare the variable or method before you use it in the
                            JSP
                            file. </p>
                        
                        <p>Following is the syntax of JSP Declarations: </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;%! declaration; [ declaration; ] ... %&gt; Following is the simple
                            example for JSP Comments: </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;%! int i = 0; %&gt; </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;%! int a, b, c; %&gt; </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;%! Circle a = new Circle(2.0); %&gt; </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Expressions: </strong><br> </p>
                        
                        <p>JSP expression element contains a scripting language expression that is
                            evaluated, converted to a String,
                            and inserted where the expression appears in the JSP file. Because the
                            value
                            of an expression is
                            converted to a String, you can use an expression within a line of text,
                            whether or not it is tagged with
                            HTML, in a JSP file. The expression element can contain any expression
                            that
                            is valid according to the
                            Java Language Specification but you cannot use a semicolon to end an
                            expression. Following is the syntax
                            of JSP Expression: </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;%= expression %&gt; Following is the simple example for JSP
                            Expression:
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;html&gt; </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;head&gt; </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;title&gt;JSP Expressions&lt;/title&gt; </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;/head&gt; </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;body&gt; </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;p&gt; </p>
                        
                        <p>Today's date: &lt;%= (new java.util.Date()).toLocaleString()%&gt;
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;/body&gt; </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;/html&gt; </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>This would generate following result: </strong><br> Today's date:
                            10-Jan-2018 21:24:25 </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>iv) Comments: </strong><br></p>
                        
                        <p>JSP comment marks text or statements that the JSP container should
                            ignore. A
                            JSP comment is useful when
                            you want to hide or "comment out" part of your JSP page. </p>

                        <p><strong>JSP Implicit Objects: </strong><br></p>
                        
                        <p>JSP Implicit Objects are the Java objects that the JSP Container makes
                            available to developers in each
                            page and developer can call them directly without being explicitly
                            declared.
                            JSP Implicit Objects are
                            also called predefined variables. JSP supports nine Implicit Objects

                            </strong><br> object. Each time a client
                            requests a page the JSP engine creates a new object to represent that
                            request. The request object
                            provides methods to get HTTP header information including form data,
                            cookies, HTTP methods etc. </p>

                        <p>The response object is an instance of a
                            "<strong>javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse </strong><br><strong>"
                            </strong><br> object. Just as the server
                            creates the request object, it also creates an object to represent the
                            response to the client. The
                            response object also defines the interfaces that deal with creating new
                            HTTP
                            headers. Through this
                            object the JSP programmer can add new cookies or date stamps, HTTP
                            status
                            codes etc. </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>The out Object: </strong><br></p>
                        
                        <p>The out object is an instance of a <strong>"
                            </strong><br><strong>javax.servlet.jsp.JspWriter </strong><br>" object
                            and is used to send content in a response. The initial JspWriter object
                            is
                            instantiated differently
                            depending on whether the page is buffered or not. Buffering can be
                            easily
                            turned off by using the
                            buffered='false' attribute of the page directive. The JspWriter object
                            contains most of the same methods
                            as the java.io.PrintWriter class. However, JspWriter has some additional
                            methods designed to deal with
                            buffering. Unlike the PrintWriter object, JspWriter throws IOExceptions.
                            Following are the important
                            methods which we would use to write boolean char, int, double, object,
                            String etc. </p>

                            through
                            its entire lifecycle. This
                            object is created when the JSP page is initialized and will be removed

                            and is a direct wrapper around the ServletConfig object for the
                            generated
                            servlet. This object allows
                            the JSP programmer access to the Servlet or JSP engine initialization
                            parameters such as the paths or

                            might
                            ever use, and its usage is
                            trivial: <strong>config.getServletName </strong><br><strong>();

                        <p><strong>Using Beans in JSP: </strong><br></p>
                        
                        <p>Java beans are reusable Java components. We can use simple Java bean in
                            the
                            JSP. This can help us in
                            keeping the business logic separate from presentation logic. Beans are
                            used
                            in the JSP pages as the
                            instance of class. We must specify the scope of the bean in the JSP
                            page.
                            Here scope of the bean means
                            the range time span of the bean for its existence in JSP. When bean is
                            present in particular scope its
                            <strong>id </strong><br>also available in that scope. There are various
                            scopes using which the bean can be
                            used in JSP page.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Page scope: </strong><br>The bean object gets disappeared as soon
                            as
                            the current page is discarded.
                            The default scope for a bean in JSP page is <strong>page </strong><br>
                            scope.<strong> </strong><br></p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Request scope: </strong><br> The bean object remains in existence
                            as
                            long as the request object is
                            present.<strong> </strong><br></p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Session scope: </strong><br> A session can be defined as the
                            specific
                            period of a time the user spends
                            browsing the site. <strong> </strong><br></p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Application scope: </strong><br> During application scope the
                            bean
                            will get stored to ServletContext.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Hence particular bean is available to all the servlets in the same web
                            application.<strong> </strong><br></p>

                        <p>Cookies are text files stored on the client computer and they are kept
                            for
                            various information tracking
                            purposes. JSP transparently supports HTTP cookies using underlying
                            servlet
                            technology. </p>

                        <p>Server script sends a set of cookies to the browser. For example name,
                            age,
                            or identification number etc.

                        <p>Browser stores this information on local machine for future use. </p>
                        
                        <p>When next time browser sends any request to web server then it sends
                            those
                            cookies information to the
                            server and server uses that information to identify the user or may be
                            for
                            some other purpose as well.

                        <p>Using Sessions: </p>
                        
                        <p>JSP makes use of servlet provided HttpSession Interface which provides a
                            way
                            to identify a user across
                            more than one page request or visit to a Web site and to store
                            information
                            about that user. By default,
                            JSPs have session tracking enabled and a new HttpSession object is
                            instantiated for each new client
                            automatically. Disabling session tracking requires explicitly turning it
                            off
                            by setting the page
                            directive session attribute to false as follows: </p>
                        
                        <p>&lt;%@ page session="false" %&gt; </p>
                        
                        <p>The JSP engine exposes the HttpSession object to the JSP author through
                            the
                            implicit <strong>session
                            </strong><br>object. Since <strong>session </strong><br>object is
                            already
                            provided to the JSP programmer, the
                            programmer can immediately begin storing and retrieving data from the
                            object
                            without any initialization
                            or getSession(). Here is a summary of important methods available

                            session object: </p>

                        <p><strong>INTRODUCTION: </strong><br></p>
                        
                        <p>Software components are self-contained software units developed according
                            to
                            the motto </p>
                        
                        <p>"Developed them once, run and reused them everywhere". Or in other words,
                            reusability is the main concern
                            behind the component model. A software component is a reusable object
                            that
                            can be plugged into any
                            target software application. You can develop software components using
                            various programming languages,
                            such as C, C++, Java, and Visual Basic. </p>
                        
                        <p>A "Bean" is a reusable software component model based on sun's java bean
                            specification that can be
                            manipulated visually in a builder tool. </p>
                        
                        <p>The term software component model describe how to create and use reusable
                            software components to build an
                            application </p>
                        
                        <p>Builder tool is nothing but an application development tool which lets
                            you
                            both to create new beans or
                            use existing beans to create an application. </p>
                        
                        <p>To enrich the software systems by adopting component technology JAVA came
                            up
                            with the concept called Java
                            Beans. </p>
                        
                        <p>Java provides the facility of creating some user defined components by
                            means
                            of Bean programming. </p>
                        
                        <p>We create simple components using java beans. </p>
                        
                        <p>We can directly embed these beans into the software. </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>ADVANTAGES OF JAVA BEANS: </strong><br></p>
                        
                        <p>The java beans posses the property of "Write once and run anywhere". 
                            Beans
                            can work in different local
                            platforms. </p>
                        
                        <p>Beans have the capability of capturing the events sent by other objects
                            and
                            vice versa enabling object
                            communication. </p>
                        
                        <p>The properties, events and methods of the bean can be controlled by the
                            application developer. (ex. Add
                            new properties) </p>
                        
                        <p>Beans can be configured with the help of auxiliary software during design
                            time.(no hassle at runtime)
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The configuration setting can be made persistent.(reused) </p>
                        
                        <p>Configuration setting of a bean can be saved in persistent storage and
                            restored later. </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>WHAT CAN WE DO/CREATE BY USING JAVABEANS: </strong><br></p>
                        
                        <p>There is no restriction on the capability of a Bean. </p>
                        
                        <p>It may perform a simple function, such as checking the spelling of a
                            document, or a complex function,
                            such as forecasting the performance of a stock portfolio. A Bean may be
                            visible to an end user. One
                            example of this is a button on a graphical user interface. </p>
                        
                        <p>Software to generate a pie chart from a set of data points is an example
                            of a
                            Bean that can execute
                            locally. </p>
                        
                        <p>Bean that provides real-time price information from a stock or
                            commodities
                            exchange. </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>DEFINITION OF A BUILDER TOOL: </strong><br></p>
                        
                        <p>Builder tools allow a developer to work with JavaBeans in a convenient
                            way.
                            By examining a JavaBean by a
                            process known as Introspection, a builder tool exposes the discovered
                            features of the JavaBean for
                            visual manipulation. A builder tool maintains a list of all JavaBeans
                            available. It allows you to
                            compose the Bean into applets, application, servlets and composite
                            components (e.g. a JFrame), customize
                            its behavior and appearance by modifying its properties and connect
                            other
                            components to the event of the
                            Bean or vice versa. </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>JAVABEANS BASIC RULES: </strong><br></p>
                        
                        <p>A JavaBean should: </p>
                        
                        <p>be public </p>
                        
                        <p>implement the Serializable interface </p>
                        
                        <p>have a no-argument constructor </p>
                        
                        <p>be derived from javax.swing.JComponent or java.awt.Component if it is
                            visual
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The classes and interfaces defined in the JavaBeans package enable you to
                            create JavaBeans. The Java Bean
                            components can exist in one of the following three phases of
                            development:

                        <p>It is similar to instance variables. A bean <em>property </em>is a named
                            attribute of a bean that can
                            affect its behavior or appearance. Examples of bean properties include
                            color, label, font, font size,
                            and display size. </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Methods </strong><br></p>
                        
                        <p>Same as normal Java methods. </p>
                        
                        <p>Every property should have accessor (get) and mutator (set) method. </p>
                        
                        <p>All Public methods can be identified by the introspection mechanism. 
                            There
                            is no specific naming
                            standard for these methods. </p>

                        <p><strong>INTRODUCTION TO STRUTS FRAMEWORK: </strong><br></p>
                        
                        <p>The <strong>struts framework </strong><br> is used to develop
                            <strong>MVC-based web application </strong><br>. The
                            struts framework was initially created by <strong>Craig McClanahan
                            </strong><br> and donated to Apache
                            Foundation in May, 2000 and Struts 1.0 was released in June 2001.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Struts Architecture and Flow: </strong><br></p>
                        
                        <p>When you use Struts, the framework provides you with a controller
                            servlet,
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>ActionServlet, which is defined in the Struts libraries that are included
                            in
                            the IDE, and which is
                            automatically registered in the <sub>web.xml</sub> deployment descriptor
                            as
                            shown below. The controller
                            servlet uses a <sub>struts-config.xml</sub> file to map incoming
                            requests to
                            Struts <sub>Action</sub>
                            objects, and instantiate any <sub>ActionForm</sub> objects associated
                            with
                            the action to temporarily
                            store form data. The Action object processes requests using its
                            <sub>execute</sub> method, while making
                            use of any data stored in the form bean. Once the <sub>Action</sub>
                            object
                            processes a request, it
                            stores any new data (i.e., in the form bean, or in a separate result
                            bean),
                            and forwards the results to
                            the appropriate view.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Developing a Struts application is similar to developing any other kind
                            of
                            web application in NetBeans
                            IDE. However, you complement your web development toolkit by taking
                            advantage of the Struts support
                            provided by the IDE. For example, you use templates in the IDE to create
                            Struts <sub>Action</sub>
                            objects and <sub>ActionForm</sub> beans. Upon creation, the IDE
                            automatically registers these classes in
                            the <sub>struts-config.xml</sub> file and lets you extend this file very
                            easily using menu items in the
                            Source Editor's right-click menu. Because many web applications use JSP
                            pages for the view, Struts also
                            provides custom tag libraries which facilitate interaction with HTML
                            forms.
                            Within the IDE's Source
                            Editor, you can invoke code completion and Javadoc support that helps
                            you to
                            work efficiently with these
                            libraries.<strong> </strong><br></p>
