                        <strong>FORM attributes </strong><br></p>
                        <p>action ="[url]"<br>This attribute usually has a link to a web page that contains code which
                            processes
                            the
                            form. In our example above, we use "mailto" to tell the form to send the information as
                            an email. </p>

                        <p>method <br> =
                            <em>"get"</em>
                        </p>

                        <p>="post" </p>

                        <p>This attribute specifies how the information is sent. With the "get" method, all the
                            information is sent in one long URL string. With the "post" method, all the information
                            is sent but is "invisible" to the user. </p>


                        <p>name When creating complex forms and using scripting, you may need to specify the ="[name of
                            name of
                            the
                            form. The name should be unique - that is, you shouldn't have other form]" forms on the page
                            with
                            the
                            same form name. </p>
                        <p><strong>INPUT – attributes </strong> <br> </p>

                        <p>type The "type" attribute allows you to specify what type of form element you want
                            ="<em>text</em>"
                            to
                            use. As you can see, the "input" element can have many different forms - see ="password"
                            above for
                            examples. </p>

                        <p>="checkbox" </p>

                        <p>="radio" </p>

                        <p>="submit" </p>

                        <p>="reset" </p>

                        <p>="hidden" ="button" </p>

                        <p>checked This attribute does not have any values. When you put this attribute into the tag for
                            "radio"
                            or
                            "checkbox," they will be selected. </p>

                        <p>src Use this attribute when you have an "image" to specify the location of the image.
                            ="[url]" </p>

                        <p><strong>TEXTAREA - attributes </strong> <br> </p>

                        <p>This form element is the multi-line text box that you often seen for "comments." The opening
                            and
                            closing
                            tag surround the text that will be initially displayed. </p>

                        <p>name This attribute must be set to a unique name so you know how to refer to the form
                            ="[referring
                            element. name]" rows This attribute allows you to set the number of rows for the text
                            area.
                        </p>

                        <p>="[number]" cols This attribute allows you to set the number of columns for the text area.
                        </p>

                        <p>="[number]" </p>

                        <p><strong>SELECT - attributes </strong> <br> </p>

                        <p>The SELECT tag allows you to create "select boxes" or "drop down menus." It is the "outer"
                            element,
                            used
                            with the OPTION tag. (See the example link below) </p>

                        <p>name This attribute must be set to a unique name so you know how to refer to the form
                            ="[referring
                            element. name]" size This attribute allows you to set how many rows are visible. </p>

                        <p>="[number]" </p>

                        <p>multiple This attribute does not have any "values." When you set this attribute, it allows
                            the user
                            to
                            select more than one option. </p>

                        <p><strong>OPTION - attributes </strong> <br> </p>

                        <p> The OPTION tag is used with the SELECT tag to define the different options in the select box
                            or
                            dropdown
                            menu. The opening and closing tag surround the text that will be displayed. </p>

                        <p>value This attribute must be set to a unique name so you know how to refer to the form
                            ="[value]"
                            element. It will probably be an abbreviated version of the text that is displayed. </p>

                        <p>selected This attribute does not have any "values." When you set this attribute, it marks
                            this option
                            as
                            being "preselected." </p>

                        <p>Putting it all together... </p>

                        <p><strong>Here's a sample page using this code below: </strong> <br> </p>
                        <pre><code>

                        <h1>CSS</h1>

                        <strong> Introduction to CSS: </strong>
                        <p>
                            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed
                            on screen,
                            paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web
                            pages all
                            at once. External style sheets are stored in ".css" files. CSS is used to define styles for
                            your web
                            pages, including the design, layout, and variations in display for different devices and
                            screen sizes.
                        </p>

                        <strong>Types of CSS: </strong>
                        <p>There are three types of CSS available. They are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Inline CSS</li>
                            <li>Internal CSS</li>
                            <li>External CSS</li>
                        </ul>

                        <strong>Inline CSS: </strong>
                        <p>
                            If the styles are mentioned along with the tag, then this type of CSS is known as inline
                            CSS.
                            <strong>Example:</strong>
                            &lt;p style="text-align: justify; background-color: red"&gt;Hi, this is Inline
                            CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
                        </p>

                        <strong>Internal CSS: </strong>
                        <p>
                            For internal CSS, we write all the desired "styles" for the "selectors" along with the
                            properties and
                            values in the <strong>"head"</strong> section. And in the <strong>body</strong> section then
                            newly
                            defined selector tags are used with the actual contents.
                        </p>

                        <strong>External CSS: </strong>
                        <p>
                            Sometimes we need to apply a particular style to more than one web page; in such cases
                            external CSS can be
                            used. The main idea in this type of CSS is that the desired styles can be written in one
                            <strong>".css"</strong> file. And this file can be called in our web pages to apply the
                            styles.
                        </p>

                        <strong>CSS Selectors: </strong>
                        <p>
                            CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their element name, id,
                            class,
                            attribute, and more.
                        </p>

                        <strong>The element Selector: </strong>
                        <p>
                            The element selector selects elements based on the element name. You can select all
                            &lt;p&gt; elements on
                            a page like this (in this case, all &lt;p&gt; elements will be center-aligned, with a red
                            text color):
                            <strong>Example:</strong>
                            p { text-align: center; color: red; }
                        </p>

                        <strong>The id Selector: </strong>
                        <p>
                            The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. The
                            id of an
                            element should be unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique
                            element! To
                            select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the
                            element.
                            The style rule below will be applied to the HTML element with:
                            <strong>Example:</strong>
                            #para1 { text-align: center; color: red; }
                        </p>

                        <!-- Other sections follow... -->

                        <strong>Controlling borders of the HTML elements using CSS: </strong>
                        <p>
                            The CSS border properties allow you to specify the style, width, and color of an element's
                            border. The
                            <sub>border-style</sub> property specifies what kind of border to display. The following
                            values are
                            allowed:
                        </p>

                        <p.dotted>Example: p.dotted {border-style: dotted;} </p.dotted>
                        <p.dashed>Example: p.dashed {border-style: dashed;} </p.dashed>
                        <p.solid>Example: p.solid {border-style: solid;} </p.solid>
                        <p.double>Example: p.double {border-style: double;} </p.double>
                        <p.groove>Example: p.groove {border-style: groove;} </p.groove>
                        <p.ridge>Example: p.ridge {border-style: ridge;} </p.ridge>
                        <p.inset>Example: p.inset {border-style: inset;} </p.inset>
                        <p.outset>Example: p.outset {border-style: outset;} </p.outset>
                        <p.none>Example: p.none {border-style: none;} </p.none>
                        <p.hidden>Example: p.hidden {border-style: hidden;} </p.hidden>
                        <p.mix>Example: p.mix {border-style: dotted dashed solid double;} </p.mix>


                        <p>The <sub>border-width</sub> property specifies the width of the four borders. The width can
                            be set as a
                            specific size (in px, pt, cm, em, etc) or by using one of the three pre-defined values:
                            thin, medium, or
                            thick. The <sub>border-width</sub> property can have from one to four values (for the top
                            border, right
                            border, bottom border, and the left border). </p>

                        <p><strong>Example </strong> </p>

                        <pre><code>
p.one {
    border-style: solid;
    border-width: 5px;

    border-width: medium;
}

p.three {
    border-style: solid;
    border-width: 2px 10px 4px 20px;
}

/* The border-color property is used to set the color of the four borders. */
/* The color can be set by: */
/* - name: specify a color name, like "red" */
/* - Hex: specify a hex value, like "#ff0000" */
/* - RGB: specify an RGB value, like "rgb(255,0,0)" */
/* - transparent */

                        <p>XML stands for extensible markup language. XML is a markup language much like HTML. XML was
                            designed to
                            carry data, not to display data. XML tags are not predefined. You must define your own tags.
                            XML is
                            designed to be self-descriptive. XML is a w3c recommendation. </p>

                        <p><strong>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN XML AND HTML: </strong> <br> </p>

                        <p>XML is not a replacement for HTML. XML and HTML were designed with different goals. XML was
                            designed to
                            transport and store data, with focus on what data is. HTML was designed to display data,
                            with focus on
                            how data looks. HTML is about displaying information, while XML is about carrying
                            information. </p>

                        <p><strong>XML does not do anything: </strong> <br> May be it is a little hard to understand,
                            but XML does not
                            do
                            anything. XML was created to structure, store, and transport information. The following
                            example is a
                            note to chythu, from ravi, stored as XML:,<br>
                        <pre><code>
&lt;note&gt;
&lt;to&gt; chythu &lt;/to&gt;
&lt;from&gt; ravi &lt;/from&gt;
&lt;heading&gt;reminder&lt;/heading&gt;
&lt;body&gt;don't forget me this weekend!&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/note&gt;
                    </code></pre>


                        <p>The note above is quite self-descriptive. It has sender and receiver information, it also has
                            a heading
                            and a message body. But still, this XML document does not do anything. It is just
                            information wrapped in
                            tags. Someone must write a piece of software to send, receive or display it. </p>

                        <p><strong>With XML you invent your own tags: </strong> <br> The tags in the example above (like
                            &lt;to&gt; and
                            &lt;from&gt;) are not defined in any XML standard. These tags are "invented" by the author
                            of the XML
                            document. That is because the XML language has no predefined tags. The tags used in HTML are
                            predefined.
                            HTML documents can only use tags defined in the HTML standard (like &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;,
                            etc.). XML
                            allows the author to define his/her own tags and his/her own document structure. XML is not
                            a
                            replacement for HTML; XML is a complement to HTML. It is important to understand that XML is
                            not a
                            replacement for HTML. In most web applications, XML is used to transport data, while HTML is
                            used to
                            format and display the data. </p>

                        <p><strong>My best description of XML is this: </strong> <br> XML is a software- and
                            hardware-independent tool
                            for
                            carrying information. XML is a W3C recommendation. XML became a W3C recommendation February
                            10, 1998.
                            XML is everywhere. XML is now as important for the web as HTML was to the foundation of the
                            web. XML is
                            the most common tool for data transmissions between all sorts of applications. </p>

                        <p><strong>XML separates data from HTML: </strong> <br> If you need to display dynamic data in
                            your HTML
                            document,
                            it will take a lot of work to edit the HTML each time the data changes. With XML, data can
                            be stored in
                            separate XML files. This way you can concentrate on using HTML for layout and display, and
                            be sure that
                            changes in the underlying data will not require any changes to the HTML. With a few lines of
                            JavaScript
                            code, you can read an external XML file and update the data content of your web page.
                            <strong> </strong>
                            <br>
                        </p>

                        <p>Unique Features of XML: </p>

                        <p><strong>Sharing of data: </strong> <br> In the real world, computer systems and databases
                            contain data in
                            incompatible formats. XML data is stored in plain text format. This provides a software-
                        </p>

                        <p>and hardware-independent way of storing data. This makes it much easier to create data that
                            can be shared
                            by different applications. </p>

                        <p><strong>Transporting data: </strong> <br> One of the most time-consuming challenges for
                            developers is to
                            exchange data between incompatible systems over the internet. Exchanging data as XML greatly
                            reduces
                            this complexity, since the data can be read by different incompatible applications. </p>

                        <p><strong>Change of platform: </strong> <br> Upgrading to new systems (hardware or software
                            platforms), is
                            always
                            time consuming. Large amounts of data must be converted and incompatible data is often lost.
                            XML data is
                            stored in text format. This makes it easier to expand or upgrade to new operating systems,
                            new
                            applications, or new browsers, without losing data. </p>

                        <p><strong>Availability of data: </strong> <br> Different applications can access your data, not
                            only in HTML
                            pages, but also from XML data sources. With XML, your data can be available to all kinds of
                            "reading
                            machines" (handheld computers, voice machines, news feeds, etc), and make it more available
                            for blind
                            people, or people with other disabilities. </p>

                        <p>Structure of XML: </p>

                        <p>XML documents form a tree structure that starts at "the root" and branches to "the
                            leaves".<strong>
                            </strong> <br> An example of XML document is shown below. XML documents use a
                            self-describing and simple
                            syntax: </p>

                        <pre><code>
&lt;?XML version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?&gt;
&lt;note&gt;
    &lt;to&gt; Chythu &lt;/to&gt;
    &lt;from&gt; Ravi &lt;/from&gt;
    &lt;heading&gt;Reminder&lt;/heading&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;Don't forget me this weekend!&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/note&gt;
                        </code></pre>


                        <p>The first line is the XML declaration. It defines the XML version (1.0) and the encoding used
                            (ISO-8859-1
                            = latin-1/west European character set). The next line describes the root element of the
                            document (like
                            saying: "This document is a note"): </p>

                        <pre><code>
&lt;note&gt;
    The next 4 lines describe 4 child elements of the root (to, from, heading, and body):
    &lt;to&gt;Tove&lt;/to&gt;
    &lt;from&gt;Jani&lt;/from&gt;
    &lt;heading&gt;Reminder&lt;/heading&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;Don't forget me this weekend!&lt;/body&gt;
    And finally, the last line defines the end of the root element:
&lt;/note&gt;
                        </code></pre>


                        <p>You can assume, from this example, that the XML document contains a note to Tove from Jani.
                            Don't you
                            agree that XML is pretty self-descriptive? XML documents form a tree structure XML documents
                            must
                            contain a root element. This element is "the parent" of all other elements. The elements in
                            an XML
                            document form a document tree. The tree starts at the root and branches to the lowest level
                            of the tree.
                            All elements can have sub elements (child elements): </p>
                        <pre><code>
    &lt;root&gt;
        &lt;child&gt;
            &lt;subchild&gt;.....&lt;/subchild&gt;
        &lt;/child&gt;
    &lt;/root&gt;
                        </code></pre>



                        <p>The terms parent, child, and sibling are used to describe the relationships between elements.
                            Parent
                            elements have children. Children on the same level are called siblings (brothers or
                            sisters). All
                            elements can have text content and attributes (just like in html). <strong>Example:
                            </strong> <br> </p>

                        <pre><code>

                        &lt;/bookstore&gt;
                        </code></pre>


                        <p>The root element in the example is &lt;bookstore&gt;. All &lt;book&gt; elements in the
                            document are
                            contained within &lt;bookstore&gt;. The &lt;book&gt; element has 4 children: &lt;title&gt;,
                            &lt;author&gt;, &lt;year&gt;, and &lt;price&gt;. </p>

                        <p><strong>XML syntax rules: </strong> <br> </p>

                        <p>The syntax rules of XML are very simple and logical. The rules are easy to learn, and easy to
                            use. All
                            XML elements must have a closing tag. In HTML, Elements do not have to have a closing tag:
                        </p>

                        <pre><code>
                        &lt;p&gt;this is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;this is another paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
                        In XML, it is illegal to omit the closing tag. All elements must have a closing tag:
                        &lt;p&gt;this is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;this is another paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
                        </code></pre>


                        <p><strong>Note: </strong> <br> You might have noticed from the previous example that the XML
                            declaration did
                            not
                            have a closing tag. This is not an error. The declaration is not a part of the XML document
                            itself, and
                            it has no closing tag. </p>

                        <p><strong>XML tags are case sensitive: </strong> <br> The tag &lt;letter&gt; is different from
                            the tag
                            &lt;LETTER&gt;. Opening and closing tags must be written with the same case: </p>

                        <pre><code>
                &lt;Message&gt;This is incorrect&lt;/MESSAGE&gt; 
                &lt;Message&gt;This is correct&lt;/Message&gt; 
            </code></pre>

                        <p><strong>Note: </strong> <br> "Opening and closing tags" are often referred to as "start and
                            end tags". Use
                            whatever you prefer. It is exactly the same thing. </p>

                        <p><strong>XML elements must be properly nested: </strong> <br> In html, you might see
                            improperly nested
                            elements:
                            &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;this text is bold and italic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;!--This is
                            wrong--&gt; In XML,
                            all elements must be properly nested within each other: </p>

                        <pre><code>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;this text is bold and italic&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  </code></pre>

                        <p>In the example above, "properly nested" simply means that since the &lt;i&gt; element is
                            opened inside
                            the &lt;b&gt; element, it must be closed inside the &lt;b&gt; element. </p>

                        <p><strong>XML documents must have a root element: </strong> <br> XML documents must contain one
                            element that is
                            the parent of all other elements. This element is called the root element. &lt;root&gt; </p>

                    &lt;child&gt;

                        <p><strong>XML attribute values must be quoted: </strong><br>XML elements can have attributes in
                            name/value
                            pairs just like in html. In XML, the attribute values must always be quoted. Study the two
                            XML documents
                            below. The first one is incorrect, the second is correct: </p>

                        <pre><code>
                        &lt;note date=12/11/2007&gt;

                &lt;/note&gt; </code></pre>

                        <p>The error in the first document is that the date attribute in the note element is not quoted.
                            <strong>Entity References: </strong><br>Some characters have a special meaning in XML. If
                            you place a
                            character like "&lt;" inside an XML element, it will generate an error because the parser
                            interprets it
                            as the start of a new element. This will generate an XML error:

                        <p>Note: only the characters "&lt;" and "&amp;" are strictly illegal in XML. the greater than
                            character is
                            legal, but it is a good habit to replace it. </p>

                        <p><strong>Comments in XML: </strong><br>The syntax for writing comments in XML is similar to
                            that of html. </p>

                        <p>&lt;!-- this is a comment --&gt; white-space is preserved in XML </p>

                        <p>HTML truncates multiple white-space characters to one single white-space: </p>

                        <p><strong>HTML: </strong><br>hello tove </p>

                        <p><strong>Output: </strong><br> hello tove </p>

                        <p>With XML, the white-space in a document is not truncated. </p>

                        <p>XML stores new line as lf in windows applications, a new line is normally stored as a pair of
                            characters:
                            carriage return (cr) and line feed (lf). In UNIX applications, a new line is normally stored
                            as an lf
                            character. Macintosh applications also use an lf to store a new line. XML stores a new line
                            as lf. </p>

                        <p>Basic Building Blocks of XML Documents: </p>

                        <p>All XML documents are made up the following four building blocks: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Elements/Tags</li>
                            <li>Attributes </li>
                            <li>Entities</li>
                            <li>Character Data </li>
                            <li>Parsed Character Data (PCDATA)</li>
                            <li>Unparsed Character Data (CDATA)</li>
                        </ul>


                        <p><strong>i </strong><strong>) XML Elements/Tags: </strong><br></p>

                        <p>An XML element is everything from (including) the element's start tag to (including) the
                            element's end
                            tag. An element can contain: other elements text, attributes or a mix of all of the above.


                        <pre><code>
&lt;bookstore&gt;
    &lt;book category="children"&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;harry potter&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;author&gt;j k. rowling&lt;/author&gt;
        &lt;year&gt;2005&lt;/year&gt;
        &lt;price&gt;29.99&lt;/price&gt;
    &lt;/book&gt;
    
    &lt;book category="web"&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;learning XML&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;author&gt;erik t. ray&lt;/author&gt;
        &lt;year&gt;2003&lt;/year&gt;
        &lt;price&gt;39.95&lt;/price&gt;
    &lt;/book&gt;
&lt;/bookstore&gt;
                        </code></pre>

                        <p>In the example above, &lt;bookstore&gt; and &lt;book&gt; have element contents, because they
                            contain
                            other elements. &lt;book&gt; also has an attribute (category="children"). &lt;title&gt;,
                            &lt;author&gt;,
                            &lt;year&gt;, and &lt;price&gt; have text content because they contain text. </p>

                        <p><strong>XML Naming Rules: </strong><br></p>

                        <p>XML elements must follow these naming rules: </p>

                        <p>Names can contain letters, numbers, and other characters </p>

                        <p>Names cannot start with a number or punctuation character </p>

                        <p>Names cannot start with the letters XML (or XML, or XML, etc) </p>

                        <p>Names cannot contain spaces </p>

                        <p>Any name can be used, no words are reserved. </p>

                        <p><strong>Best Naming Practices: </strong><br></p>

                        <p>Make names descriptive. Names with an underscore separator are nice: &lt;first_name&gt;,
                            &lt;last_name&gt;. </p>

                        <p>Names should be short and simple, like this: &lt;book_title&gt; not like this:
                            &lt;the_title_of_the_book&gt;. </p>

                        <p>Avoid "-" characters. If you name something "first-name," some software may think you want to
                            subtract
                            name from first. </p>

                        <p>Avoid "." characters. If you name something "first.name," some software may think that "name"
                            is a
                            property of the object "first." </p>

                        <p>Avoid ":" characters. Colons are reserved to be used for something called namespaces (more
                            later). </p>

                        <p>XML documents often have a corresponding database. a good practice is to use the naming rules
                            of your
                            database for the elements in the XML documents. </p>

                        <p>Non-english letters like éòá are perfectly legal in XML, but watch out for problems if your
                            software
                            vendor doesn't support them. </p>

                        <p><strong> </strong><br></p>

                        <p><strong>XML Elements are Extensible: </strong><br></p>

                        <p>XML elements can be extended to carry more information. look at the following XML example:
                        </p>

                        <pre><code>
                    &lt;note&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                    
                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;to&gt;Chythu&lt;/to&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                    
                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;from&gt;Ravi&lt;/from&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                    
                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;body&gt;Don't forget me this weekend!&lt;/body&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                    
                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                    
                    &lt;p&gt;Let‟s imagine that we created an application that extracted the &lt;to&gt;, &lt;from&gt;, and
                    &lt;body&gt; elements from the XML document to produce this output: Message to: Chythu from: Ravi &lt;/p&gt;
                    
                    &lt;p&gt;Don't forget me this weekend! &lt;/p&gt;
                    
                    &lt;p&gt;Imagine that the author of the XML document added some extra information to it: &lt;/p&gt;
                    
                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;note&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                    
                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;date&gt;2008-01-10&lt;/date&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;from&gt;Ravi&lt;/from&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                    
                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;heading&gt;reminder&lt;/heading&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                    
                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;body&gt;don't forget me this weekend!&lt;/body&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                    
                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                    </code></pre>


                        <p><strong>Should the application break or crash? </strong><br></p>

                        <p>No, the application should still be able to find the &lt;to&gt;, &lt;from&gt;, and
                            &lt;body&gt; elements
                            in the XML document and produce the same output. One of the beauties of XML is that it can
                            be extended
                            without breaking applications. </p>

                        <p><strong>ii) XML Attributes: </strong><br></p>

                        <p>XML elements can have attributes, just like html. Attributes provide additional information
                            about an
                            element. In html, attributes provide additional information about elements: &lt;img
                            src="computer.gif"&gt; </p>

                        <p>&lt;a href="demo.asp"&gt; </p>

                        <p>Attributes often provide information that is not a part of the data. In the example below,
                            the file type
                            is irrelevant to the data, but can be important to the software that wants to manipulate the
                            element:
                        </p>

                        <p>&lt;file type="gif"&gt;computer.gif&lt;/file&gt; </p>

                        <p><strong>XML attributes must be quoted: </strong><br>Attribute values must always be quoted.
                            Either single or
                            double quotes can be used. For a person's sex, the person element can be written like this:
                        </p>

                        <pre><code>
                        &lt;person sex="female"&gt; &lt;/person&gt;
                        
                        &lt;person sex='female'&gt; &lt;/person&gt;
                        
                        &lt;gangster name='george "shotgun" ziegler'&gt; &lt;/gangster&gt;
                        
                        &lt;gangster name="george &amp;quot;shotgun&amp;quot; ziegler"&gt; &lt;/gangster&gt;
                        
                        &lt;person gender="male"&gt; &lt;/person&gt;
                        
                        &lt;firstname&gt;Ravi&lt;/firstname&gt;
                        
                        &lt;lastname&gt;Chythanya&lt;/lastname&gt;
                        
                        &lt;person&gt; &lt;/person&gt;
                        
                        &lt;gender&gt;male&lt;/gender&gt;
                        
                        &lt;firstname&gt;Ravi&lt;/firstname&gt;
                        
                        &lt;lastname&gt;Chythanya&lt;/lastname&gt;
                        
                        &lt;/person&gt;
                        </code></pre>

                        <p>In the first example gender is an attribute. In the next, gender is an element. Both examples
                            provide the
                            same information. There are no rules about when to use attributes or when to use elements.
                            Attributes
                            are handy in html. In XML my advice is to avoid them. Use elements instead. </p>

                        <p><strong>My </strong><br><strong>favorite </strong><br><strong> way: </strong><br></p>

                        <p>The following three XML documents contain exactly the same information: </p>

                        <p>A date attribute is used in the first example: </p>

                        <pre><code>
                    &lt;note date="10/01/2008"&gt; &lt;/note&gt;
                    
                    &lt;note&gt; &lt;date&gt;10/01/2008&lt;/date&gt; &lt;/note&gt;
                    
                    &lt;note&gt; &lt;date&gt; 
                        &lt;day&gt;10&lt;/day&gt; 
                        &lt;month&gt;01&lt;/month&gt; 
                        &lt;year&gt;2008&lt;/year&gt;

                        <p><strong>Avoid XML attributes? </strong><br></p>

                        <p>Some of the problems with using attributes are: </p>

                        <p>Attributes cannot contain multiple values (elements can) </p>

                        <p>Attributes cannot contain tree structures (elements can) </p>

                        <p>Attributes are not easily expandable (for future changes) </p>

                        <p>Attributes are difficult to read and maintain. use elements for data. use attributes for
                            information that
                            is not relevant to the data. </p>

                        <p>Don't end up like this: </p>

                        <p>&lt;note day="10" month="01" year="2008" to="tove" from="jani" heading="reminder" body="don't

                            this weekend!"&gt; &lt;/note&gt; </p>

                        <p><strong>XML attributes for metadata: </strong><br></p>

                        <p>Sometimes ID references are assigned to elements. These IDs can be used to identify XML
                            elements in much
                            the same way as the id attribute in html. This example demonstrates this: </p>

                        <pre><code>
                        &lt;messages&gt;

                            &lt;/note&gt;

                        <p>The ID attributes above are for identifying the different notes. It is not a part of the note
                            itself.
                            What I'm trying to say here is that metadata (data about data) should be stored as
                            attributes, and the
                            data itself should be stored as elements. </p>

                        <p><strong>XML Entities: </strong><br></p>

                        <p>An entity is the symbolic representation of some information. It references the data that
                            look like an
                            abbreviation or can be found at an external location. Entities reduce the redundant
                            information and also
                            allow for easier editing. The entities can be internal or external. For example, the entity
                            <strong>„&amp;amp;‟ </strong><br> will replace as <strong>„&amp;‟ </strong><br>, where ever
                            it is found in
                            the XML
                            document.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>PCDATA: </strong><br></p>

                        <p>PCDATA stands for Parsed Character Data. The text enclosed between starting and ending tag is
                            known as
                            Character Data. The parser parses the PCDATA and identifies the entities as well as markup.
                            Markups
                            include the tags inside the text and entities are expanded. In the case of Parsed Character
                            Data, the
                            symbols „&amp;‟, „&lt;‟, „&gt;‟ are represented using entities. <strong>v) CDATA:
                            </strong><br></p>

                        <p>CDATA stands for Character Data and it is not parsed by the parser. The tags inside the text
                            are not
                            considered as markup and the entities are not expanded. </p>

                        <p>1) XML with correct syntax is <strong>Well Formed XML </strong><br>. 2) XML validated against
                            a DTD is

                        <p>The purpose of a DTD is to define the structure of an XML document. It defines the structure

                        <p>XML Schema: </p>

                        <p>W3C supports an XML-based alternative to DTD, called XML schema: </p>

                        <p>The XML schema is used to represent the structure of XML document. The goal or purpose of XML
                            schema is
                            to define the building blocks of an XML document. These can be used as an alternative to XML
                            DTD. The
                            XML schema language is called as XML Schema Definition (XSD) language. The XML schema became
                            the World
                            Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation in 2001. </p>

                        <p>XML schema defines elements, attributes, elements having child elements, order of child
                            elements. It also
                            defines fixed and default values of elements and attributes. 3) XML schema also allows the
                            developers to
                            use data types. </p>

                        <p>4) File extension of XML schema is ".xsd" i.e., Filename.xsd <strong>Ex: </strong><br> </p>
