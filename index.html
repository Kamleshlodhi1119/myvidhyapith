        <ol>
            <li>A technical definition of the World Wide Web is all the resources and users on the Internet that are using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). </li>
            <li> broader definition comes from the organization that Web inventor Tim Bemers-Lee helped found the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</li>
            <li> The World Wide Web is the universe of network-accessible information, an embodiment of human knowledge.</li>
            <li> In simple terms, The World Wide Web is a way of exchanging information between computers on the Interet, tying them together into avast collection of interactive multimedia resources</li>
            <li> Internet and Web is not the same thing Web uses internet to pass over the information</li>
            <h2>Evolution of WWW </h2>
            <p>World Wide Web was created by Timothy Bemers Lee in 1989 at CERN in Geneva World Wide Web came into existence as a proposal by him, to allow researchers to work together effectively and efficiently at CERN. Eventually it became World Wide
                Web.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Domain-</h2>
            <p> A domain is a part of the web address nomenclature someone would use to find your website or a page of your website online. It is a string of text associated with the numerical IP address of a website that's much easier for people to remember
                and search.</p>
            <p> Every website has an IP address, which is a unique string of numbers that connect computers to web servers. IP addresses are great for computers, but difficult for people to memorize. That's where domains come in. A domain name is connected
                to a website's IP address so people can more easily remember and search for a website by its domain and ther browser can still find the specific web server that hosts the webste via the associated IP address</p>
            <p> A domain typically consists of two or three words separated by dots.</p>
            <p>For example:https://blog.hubspot.com/service/what-is-a-domain.</p>
        </ol>
        <p> It's made up of the following parts:
            <ol>
                <li>protocol ("https://")</li>
                <li>domain name ("blog.hubspot.com") </li>
                <li>subdomain ("blog.")</li>
                <li>second-level doman (hubspot) </li>
                <li>top-level domain.com)</li>
                <li>subdirectory (/website/") </li>
                <li>path('/what-is-a-domain") </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        < <p>Not including its extension, like.com",the maximum length can be one characters. The minimum length can be one character</p>
    <p> The top-level domain is the extension, or the part of your domain that comes after your second- level domain. it specifies what type of entity your organization registers as on the internet. Generic Top-Level Domains (gTLD) BTLD refers to the best
        known and most broadly used TLDS:
        <ul>
            <li>.com </li>
            <li>.net</li>
            <li>.biz</li>
            <li>.org</li>
            <li>.info</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3> Country Code Top-Level Domains (ccTLD)</h3>
    <p>

        These two-letter TLDs refer to specific geographical locations. Here are the most common ones:
        <ul>
            <li> .in(India)</li>
            <li> .cn (China)</li>
            <li> .ru (Russia)</li>

        <h3>HTTP</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.</li>
            <li>It is a protocol used to access the data on the World Wide Web (www). </li>
            <li>The HTTP protocol can be used to transfer the data in the form of plain text, hypertext, audio, video, and so on.
            </li>
            <li>This protocol is known as HyperText Transfer Protocol because of its efficiency that allows us to use in a hypertext environment where there are rapid jumps from one document to another document. </li>
            <li> HTTP is similar to the FTP as it also transfers the files from one host to another host. But, HTTP is simpler than FTP as HTTP uses only one connection, i.e., no control connection to transfer the files. </li>

            <li>HTTP is used to carry the data in the form of MIME-like format.
            </li>
            <li> HTTP is similar to SMTP as the data is transferred between client and server.The HTTP differs from the SMTP in the way the messages are sent from the client to the server and from server to the client.SMTP messages are stored and forwarded
                while HTTP messages are delivered immediately.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </P>
    <p>
        <h3> Features of HTTP:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Connectionless protocol: HTTP is a connectionless protocol. HTTP client initiates a request and waits for a response from the server. When the server receives the request, the server processes the request and sends back the response to the
                HTTP client after which the client disconnects the connection. The connection between client and server exist only during the current request and response time only.</li>
            <LI>Media independent: HTTP protocol is a media independent as data can be sent as long as both the client and server know how to handle the data content. It is required for both the client and server to specify the content type in MIME-type header
            </LI>
            <li>Stateless: HTTP is a stateless protocol as both the client and server know each other only during the current request. Due to this nature of the protocol, both the client and server do not retain the information between various requests of
                the web pages.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="https://github.com/Kamleshlodhi1119/myvidhyapith/blob/main/Screenshot%20(16).png?raw=true" width="500px" class="vin"></p>
    <p>Communication between clients and servers is done by requests and responses:
        <ul>
            <li>A client (a browser) sends an HTTP request to the web.</li>
            <li>An web server receives the request</li>
            <li>The server runs an application to process the request </li>
            <li> The server returns an HTTP response (output) to the browser</li>
            <li>The client (the browser) receives the response </li>
        </ul>
        Request Message: The request message is sent by the client that consists of a request line, headers, and sometimes a body</li>
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="https://github.com/Kamleshlodhi1119/myvidhyapith/blob/main/Screenshot%20(20).png?raw=true" width=" 400px " class="vin "></p>
    <p>Response Message: The response message is sent by the server to the client that consists of a status line, headers, and sometimes a body</p>
    <p>

        <h3>Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A client that wants to access the document in an internet needs an address and to facilitate the access of documents, the HTTP uses the concept of Uniform Resource Locator (URL).</li>
            <li> The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a standard way of specifying any kind of information on the internet.</li>
            <li>The URL defines four parts: method, host computer, port, and path</li>
            <li>Method: The method is the protocol used to retrieve the document from a server. For example, HTTP.</li>
            <img src="https://github.com/Kamleshlodhi1119/myvidhyapith/blob/main/Screenshot%20(19).png?raw=true " width="500px " class="vin ">
            <li>Host: The host is the computer where the information is stored, and the computer is given an alias name. Web pages are mainly stored in the computers and the computers are given an alias name that begins with the characters "www ". This field
                is not mandatory</li>
            <li>Port: The URL can also contain the port number of the server, but it's an optional field. If the port number is included, then it must come between the host and path and it should be separated from the host by a colon.</li>
            <li> Path: Path is the pathname of the file where the information is stored. The path itself contain slashes that separate the directories from the subdirectories and files</li>

        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>

        <h3>Web Browser</h3>
        <p> A browser is a software program that is used to explore, retrieve, and display the information available on the World Wide Web. This information may be in the form of pictures, web pages, videos, and other files that all are connected via hyperlinks
            and categorized with the help of URLs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). For example, you are viewing this page by using a browser.</p>
        <P> A browser is a client program as it runs on a user computer or mobile device and contacts the webserver for the information requested by the user. The web server sends the data back to the browser that displays the results on internet supported
            devices. On behalf of the users, the browser sends requests to web servers all over the internet by using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). A browser requires a smartphone, computer, or tablet and internet to work.</p>
    </P>
    <p>History of Web Browser
        <br># The WorldWideWeb was the first web browser. It was created by W3C Director Tim Berners-Lee in 1990. Later, it was renamed Nexus to avoid confusion caused by the actual World Wide Web.<br> #The Lynx browser was a text-based browser, which
        was invented in 1992. It was not able to display the graphical content.<br># Although, the first graphical user interface browser was NCSA Mosaic. It was the first most popular browser in the world, which was introduced in 1993.<br># In 1994,
        there were some improvements occurred in Mosaic and came to Netscape Navigator.<br># In 1995, Microsoft introduced the Internet Explorer It was the first web browser developed by Microsoft.<br># A research project started on Opera in 1994. Later,
        it was publicly introduced in 1996.<br>#Apple 's Safari browser was introduced in 2003. It was specifically released for Macintosh computers.<br># In 2004, Mozilla introduced Firefox as Netscape Navigator.<br># In 2007, a browser Mobile Safari
        was released as Apple mobile web browser.<br># The popular browser Google Chrome was launched in 2008
        <br>#The fast-growing mobile-based browser Opera Mini was released in 2011.
        <br>#The Microsoft Edge browser was launched in 2015.</p>
    <p>
        <h3>Features of Web Browser </h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Refresh button:</b> Refresh button allows the website to reload the contents of the web pages. Most of the web browsers store local copies of visited pages to enhance the performance by using a caching mechanism.</li>
            <li><b>Stop button:</b> It is used to cancel the communication of the web browser with the server and stops loading the page content. For example, if any malicious site enters the browser accidentally, it helps to save from it by clicking on the
                stop button.
            </li>
            <li><b>Home button:</b> It provides users the option to bring up the predefined home page of the website.</li>
            <li><b>Web address bar:</b> It allows the users to enter a web address in the address bar and visit the website.
            </li>
            <li><b>Tabbed browsing: </b>It provides users the option to open multiple websites on a single window. It helps users to read different websites at the same time.</li>
            <li><b>Bookmarks:</b> It allows the users to select particular website to save it for the later retrieval of information, which is predefined by the users.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Component of a Web browser</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>User Interface: </b> The user interface is an area where the user can use several options like address bar, back and forward button, menu, bookmarking, and many other options to interact with the browser. </li>

            <li>
                <b>Browser Engine:</b>It connects the UI (User Interface) and the rendering engine as a bridge. It queries and manipulates the rendering engine based on inputs from several user interfaces.</li>
            <li><b>Rendering Engine:</b>It is responsible for displaying the requested content on the browser screen. It translates the HTML, XML files, and images, which are formatted by using the CSS. It generates the layout of the content and displays
                it on the browser screen. Although it can also display the other types of content by using different types of plugins or extensions. such as:
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Internet Explorer uses Trident</li>
                <li>Chrome & Opera 15+ use Blink</li>
                <LI>Chrome (iPhone) & Safari use Webkit</LI>
                <li>Firefox & other Mozilla browsers use Gecko</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="https://github.com/Kamleshlodhi1119/myvidhyapith/blob/126edec75c817536e8319a3478cd69ae97a56d0f/Screenshot%20(27).png?raw=true " width="500px " class="vin ">
            <li> <b>Networking:</b> It retrieves the URLs by using internet protocols like HTTP or FTP. It is responsible for maintaining all aspects of Internet communication and security. Furthermore, it may be used to cache a retrieved document to reduce
                network traffic
            </li>
            <LI>
                <B>javaScript Interpreter:</B> As the name suggests, JavaScript Interpreter translates and executes the JavaScript code, which is included in a website. The translated results are sent to the rendering engine to display results on the device screen.</LI>
            <li>
                <b>UI Backend:</b> It is used to draw basic combo boxes and Windows (widgets). It specifies a generic interface, which is not platform-specific.</li>
            <li><b>Data Storage:</b>> The data storage is a persistence layer that is used by the browser to store all sorts of information locally, like cookies. A browser also supports different storage mechanisms such as IndexedDB, WebSQL, localStorage,
                and FileSystem. It is a database stored on the local drive of your computer where the browser is installed. It handles user data like cache, bookmarks, cookies, and preferences.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <h3>Web Architecture :</h3><br>There are a lot of web browser available in the market. All of them interpret and display information on the screen however their capabilities and structure varies depending upon implementation. But the most basic component
        that all web browser must exhibit are listed below:
        <ol>
            <li>Controller/Dispatcher</li>
            <li>Interpreter</li>
            <li>Client Programs</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="https://github.com/Kamleshlodhi1119/myvidhyapith/blob/126edec75c817536e8319a3478cd69ae97a56d0f/Screenshot%20(28).png?raw=true " width="500px " class="vin ">
        <p>Controller works as a control unit in CPU. It takes input from the keyboard or mouse, interpret it and make other services to work on the basis of input it receives.
        </p>
        <p>Interpreter receives the information from the controller and execute the instruction line by line. Some interpreter are mandatory while some are optional For example, HTML interpreter program is mandatory and java interpreter is optional</p>
        <p>Client Program describes the specific protocol that will be used to access a particular service. Following are the client programs tat are commonly used:</p>
        <UL>
            <li>HTTP</li>
            <LI>SMTP</LI>
            <LI>FTP</LI>
            <LI>NNTP</LI>
            <lI>POP</lI>
        </UL>
    </p>
    <P>
        <h3>Web server</h3><br>
        <Ul>
            <li>Web Server is a piece of software running on a computer whose primary job is to distribute web pages to users whenever they demand it and provides an area in which to store and organise the pages of the website.</li>
            <li>The machine that executes the web server software can be a remote machine placed at the other side of your network or even on the other end of the globe, or it be your very own personal computer at home.</li>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kamleshlodhi1119/myvidhyapith/f48d706fe4c90cfa2cb0996106528b68cd1e17c9/Web-browser-Vs-Web-server1-2-1.jpg" width="500px " class="vin "> zzz
            <li>We also introduced the idea that the user`s browser was the client in this relationship.</li>
        </Ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Web 2.0</h3><br>
        <ul>

        <h3>Concept of effective web designing</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>WEBSITE PURPOSE
            </li>
            <DD>Your website needs to accommodate the needs of the user. Having a simple clear intention on all pages will help the user interact with what you have to offer. What is the purpose of your website? Are you imparting practical information like
                a `How to guide`? Is it an entertainment website like sports coverage or are you selling a product to the user? There are many different purposes that websites may have but there are core purposes common to all websites.</DD>
            <li>SIMPLICITY
            </li>
            <DD>Simplicity is the best way to go when considering the user experience and the usability of your website. Below are ways to achieve simplicity through design.<br> 1. Colour- Colour has the power to communicate messages and evoke emotional responses.
                Finding a colour palette that fits your brand will allow you to influence your customer`s behaviour towards your brand. Keep the colour selection limited to less than 5 colours. <br>2. Type- Typography has an important role to play on
                your website. It commands attention and works as the visual interpretation of the brands voice. <br>3. Imagery- Imagery is every visual aspect used within communications. This includes still photography, illustration, video and all forms
                of graphics. All imagery should be expressive and capture the spirit of the company and act as the embodiment of their brand personality.</DD>
            <li> NAVIGATION
            </li>
            <dd> • Navigation is the way finding system used on websites where visitors interact and find what they are looking for. Website navigation is key to retaining visitors.<br> • If the websites navigation is confusing visitors will give up and find
                what they need elsewhere. Keeping navigation simple, intuitive and consistent on every page is key.</dd>
            <li>F-SHAPED PATTERN READING
            </li>
            <dd>The F- based pattern is the most common way visitors scan text on a website. Eye tracking studies have found that most of what people see is in the top and left area of the screen. <br>• The F` shaped layout mimics our natural pattern of reading
                in the West (left to right and top to bottom). An effective designed website will work with a readers natural pattern of scanning the page.
            </dd>
            <li>VISUAL HIERARCHY
            </li>
            <dd>Visual hierarchy is the arrangement of elements is order of importance. This is done either by size, colour, imagery, contrast, typographically, whitespace, texture and style.</dd>
            <li>CONTENT
            </li>
            <dd>An effective web design has both great design and great content. Using compelling language great content can attract and influence visitors by converting them into customers</dd>
            <li>GRID BASED LAYOUT
            </li>
            <dd>Grids help to structure your design and keep your content organised. The grid helps to align elements on the page and keep it clean. The grid based layout arranges content into a clean rigid grid structure with columns, sections that line
                up and feel balanced and impose order and results in an aesthetically pleasing website</dd>
            <li>LOAD TIME
            </li>
            <dd>Waiting for a website to load will lose visitors. Nearly half of web visitors expect a site to load in 2 seconds or less and they will potentially leave a site that isn’t loaded within 3 seconds. Optimising image sizes will help load your
                site faster.</dd>
            <li>MOBILE FRIENDLY
            </li>
            <dd>More people are using their phones or other devices to browse the web. It is important to consider building your website with a responsive layout where your website can adjust to different screens.</dd>
