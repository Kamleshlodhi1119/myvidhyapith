        <ol>
            <li>A technical definition of the World Wide Web is all the resources and users on the Internet that are using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). </li>
            <li> broader definition comes from the organization that Web inventor Tim Bemers-Lee helped found the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</li>
            <li> The World Wide Web is the universe of network-accessible information, an embodiment of human knowledge.</li>
            <li> In simple terms, The World Wide Web is a way of exchanging information between computers on the Interet, tying them together into avast collection of interactive multimedia resources</li>
            <li> Internet and Web is not the same thing Web uses internet to pass over the information</li>
            <h2>Evolution of WWW </h2>
            <p>World Wide Web was created by Timothy Bemers Lee in 1989 at CERN in Geneva World Wide Web came into existence as a proposal by him, to allow researchers to work together effectively and efficiently at CERN. Eventually it became World Wide
                Web.
            </p><hr>
            <h2>Domain-</h2>
            <p> A domain is a part of the web address nomenclature someone would use to find your website or a page of your website online. It is a string of text associated with the numerical IP address of a website that's much easier for people to remember
                and search.</p>
            <p> Every website has an IP address, which is a unique string of numbers that connect computers to web servers. IP addresses are great for computers, but difficult for people to memorize. That's where domains come in. A domain name is connected
                to a website's IP address so people can more easily remember and search for a website by its domain and ther browser can still find the specific web server that hosts the webste via the associated IP address</p>
            <p> A domain typically consists of two or three words separated by dots.</p>
            <p>For example:https://blog.hubspot.com/service/what-is-a-domain.</p>
        </ol>
        <p> It's made up of the following parts:
            <ol>
                <li>protocol ("https://")</li>
                <li>domain name ("blog.hubspot.com") </li>
                <li>subdomain ("blog.")</li>
                <li>second-level doman (hubspot) </li>
                <li>top-level domain.com)</li>
                <li>subdirectory (/website/") </li>
                <li>path('/what-is-a-domain") </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        < <p>Not including its extension, like.com",the maximum length can be one characters. The minimum length can be one character</p>
    <p> The top-level domain is the extension, or the part of your domain that comes after your second- level domain. it specifies what type of entity your organization registers as on the internet. Generic Top-Level Domains (gTLD) BTLD refers to the best
        known and most broadly used TLDS:
        <ul>
            <li>.com </li>
            <li>.net</li>
            <li>.biz</li>
            <li>.org</li>
            <li>.info</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3> Country Code Top-Level Domains (ccTLD)</h3>
    <p>

        These two-letter TLDs refer to specific geographical locations. Here are the most common ones:
        <ul>
            <li> .in(India)</li>
            <li> .cn (China)</li>
            <li> .ru (Russia)</li>
            <li>.uk(United Kingdom) </li>
            <li>.nl (Netherlands)</li>
        </ul> <hr>
        <h3> Internet </h3>
        <p>
            <h4> The internet is a globally connected network system facilitating worldwide communication and access to data resources through a huge collection of personal, public, business, academic and government networks. itâ€™s governed by agencies just
                like Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (or IANA) that establish universal protocols </h4>

        <h1>HTTP</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.</li>
            <li>It is a protocol used to access the data on the World Wide Web (www). </li>
            <li>The HTTP protocol can be used to transfer the data in the form of plain text, hypertext, audio, video, and so on.
            </li>
            <li>This protocol is known as HyperText Transfer Protocol because of its efficiency that allows us to use in a hypertext environment where there are rapid jumps from one document to another document. </li>
            <li> HTTP is similar to the FTP as it also transfers the files from one host to another host. But, HTTP is simpler than FTP as HTTP uses only one connection, i.e., no control connection to transfer the files. </li>

            <li>HTTP is used to carry the data in the form of MIME-like format.
            </li>
            <li> HTTP is similar to SMTP as the data is transferred between client and server.The HTTP differs from the SMTP in the way the messages are sent from the client to the server and from server to the client.SMTP messages are stored and forwarded
                while HTTP messages are delivered immediately.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </P>
    <p>
        <h3> Features of HTTP:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Connectionless protocol: HTTP is a connectionless protocol. HTTP client initiates a request and waits for a response from the server. When the server receives the request, the server processes the request and sends back the response to the
                HTTP client after which the client disconnects the connection. The connection between client and server exist only during the current request and response time only.</li>
            <LI>Media independent: HTTP protocol is a media independent as data can be sent as long as both the client and server know how to handle the data content. It is required for both the client and server to specify the content type in MIME-type header</LI>
            <li>Stateless: HTTP is a stateless protocol as both the client and server know each other only during the current request. Due to this nature of the protocol, both the client and server do not retain the information between various requests of
                the web pages.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src=" C:\Users\hp\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot (16).png "></p>
    <p>Communication between clients and servers is done by requests and responses:
        <ul>
            <li>A client (a browser) sends an HTTP request to the web.</li>
            <li>An web server receives the request</li>
            <li>The server runs an application to process the request </li>
            <li> The server returns an HTTP response (output) to the browser</li>
            <li>The client (the browser) receives the response </li>
        </ul>
        Request Message: The request message is sent by the client that consists of a request line, headers, and sometimes a body</li>
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="C:\Users\hp\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot (20).png"></p>
    <p>Response Message: The response message is sent by the server to the client that consists of a status line, headers, and sometimes a body</p>
    <p>

        <h3>Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A client that wants to access the document in an internet needs an address and to facilitate the access of documents, the HTTP uses the concept of Uniform Resource Locator (URL).</li>
            <li> The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a standard way of specifying any kind of information on the internet.</li>
            <li>The URL defines four parts: method, host computer, port, and path</li>
            <li>Method: The method is the protocol used to retrieve the document from a server. For example, HTTP.</li>
            <img src="C:\Users\hp\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot (19).png" width="1080px">
            <li>Host: The host is the computer where the information is stored, and the computer is given an alias name. Web pages are mainly stored in the computers and the computers are given an alias name that begins with the characters "www". This field
                is not mandatory</li>
            <li>Port: The URL can also contain the port number of the server, but it's an optional field. If the port number is included, then it must come between the host and path and it should be separated from the host by a colon.</li>
            <li> Path: Path is the pathname of the file where the information is stored. The path itself contain slashes that separate the directories from the subdirectories and files</li>

        </ul>
    </p>

        <h1>Web Browser</h1>
        <p> A browser is a software program that is used to explore, retrieve, and display the information available on the World Wide Web. This information may be in the form of pictures, web pages, videos, and other files that all are connected via hyperlinks
            and categorized with the help of URLs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). For example, you are viewing this page by using a browser.</p>
        <P> A browser is a client program as it runs on a user computer or mobile device and contacts the webserver for the information requested by the user. The web server sends the data back to the browser that displays the results on internet supported
            devices. On behalf of the users, the browser sends requests to web servers all over the internet by using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). A browser requires a smartphone, computer, or tablet and internet to work.</p>
    </P>
    <p>History of Web Browser
        <br># The WorldWideWeb was the first web browser. It was created by W3C Director Tim Berners-Lee in 1990. Later, it was renamed Nexus to avoid confusion caused by the actual World Wide Web.<br> #The Lynx browser was a text-based browser, which
        was invented in 1992. It was not able to display the graphical content.<br># Although, the first graphical user interface browser was NCSA Mosaic. It was the first most popular browser in the world, which was introduced in 1993.<br># In 1994,
        there were some improvements occurred in Mosaic and came to Netscape Navigator.<br># In 1995, Microsoft introduced the Internet Explorer It was the first web browser developed by Microsoft.<br># A research project started on Opera in 1994. Later,
        it was publicly introduced in 1996.<br>#Apple 's Safari browser was introduced in 2003. It was specifically released for Macintosh computers.<br># In 2004, Mozilla introduced Firefox as Netscape Navigator.<br># In 2007, a browser Mobile Safari
        was released as Apple mobile web browser.<br># The popular browser Google Chrome was launched in 2008</p>
